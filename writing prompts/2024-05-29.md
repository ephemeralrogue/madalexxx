"There is no way that this valley girl, who is charged as your bodyguard, is one of the top ten deadliest assassins in the world."

I smile in response.

"Off-putting, isn't she? All bubblegum and lollipops and she can split your skull with the flick of her wrist."

We both look at her. She's standing with her weight shifted over one leg, one hand on her protruding hip, the other twirling her long brown hair, chewing gum and looking entirely nonplussed. She's completely unbothered that we're talking about her right in front of her.

"She's done a number on you bro. Just because she's hot doesn't mean she's honest."

It was all you had to say to put her into action. A moment later, I'm leaning over, offering my hand to help pick you up.

"She's fast, isn't she?," I say as I help dust you off as you get up. "You can talk mad shit and not get the slightest reaction. But don't question her integrity."
