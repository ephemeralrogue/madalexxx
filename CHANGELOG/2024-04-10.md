- updated working branches for git flow: each project will be housed in a `content/*` protected branch, with the working copy in an `update-*` branch
- configured `post-checkout` git hook to manage per-branch `.gitignore` files per [this git gist](https://gist.github.com/ephemeralrogue/2bac099a7271a2101e9579d747e79abb). each branch has its own `.gitignore`:
	- `.gitignore.update-*`
	- `.gitignore.CHANGELOG`
- daily notes will be logged in `CHANGELOG` branch, then pushed to `main`
- the per-branch `.gitignore` git flow needs some work. when merging in from another branch with differing `excludes`, files are being merged in that do not honor the `.gitignore` of the current branch. this will require further research and effort
