## Vault
- created year and month directories for daily notes.
- current month daily notes remain in `CHANGELOG` directory and are moved into their respective folder at beginning of the new month

## Unholy Requiem (Children of the Damned)
- reorganized directory in preparation for complete rewrite
- created `first-draft` and `first-rewrite` directories
- copied and pasted content from chapter notes into new chapter headings for rewrite: [[01 - In the Beginning]], [[unholy-requiem/first-rewrite/02|02]], [[03 - The Plateau]], [[04 - The Waystation]], [[05 - The Shrine of Radiance]], [[06 - *Interlude]], [[07 - Expansion Beyond Measure]], [[08 - *Interlude]], [[unholy-requiem/first-rewrite/09|09]], [[10 - *Interlude]], [[10 - Finale]], [[11 - Epilogue]]; interlude and epilogue chapter numbers included to maintain chronology
- moved contents of main folder to `first-draft` for archival purposes
- updated [[Unholy Requiem; First Draft]] with missing content
- moved [[Unholy Requiem; First Draft]], [[Missing Chapters]] to `first-draft` for archival purposes
- began moving content around as notes provided; because many moves required large jumps, transitions, or major rework, this was limited to shifts made in the first couple of chapters
	- completed the bulk of the shifts labeled in the notes, now that a copy of the first draft exists separate from the text I'm actively working on. Only a few shifts need to be made, and those require more context than what I was leaning on for the majority of shifts I made.
- A handful of edits were made, particularly with regard to sections that were moving, or large swaths of text being removed in the latter part of the narrative.
