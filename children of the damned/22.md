The process of assimilation seemed as if it would be unending. As our borders approached those of other nations, we often entered into similar negotiations as had historically occurred. Though the most staunchly religious countries proved to be difficult, eventually they too were assimilated. Other theocratic authoritarian regimes were often taken down from within, as the more ambitious political figures and corporations found our culture to be more accommodating to their goals and aspirations. People incapable of reading, those who were manipulated by those in power, were often the front ranks of violent reaction, but were quickly pacified when they discovered their brand of faith could not protect them from our powers. They raised crosses and talismans and were easily swayed when drained of the one singular motivating force those who held sway over them used to manipulate them: emotion.

It truly began to feel as if we would eventually take the world over. It didn't matter how logical, how powerful, how resilient, how ardent a region was grounded in their nationalism. Strip away all the pride and righteous anger and all that was left was mankind's desire to survive. Strip away all the pride and pleasure in acting in concert with manufactured nationalism and the individual was left abandoning their beliefs. Whole armies would march against us, crusades wrought against us by the powers of their lands, and all would fall in subservience to our power as we drained them of their resolve. Fields of battle would be strewn with emptied human husks, not a drop of blood drawn among them all.

We rarely ever killed anyone in these confrontations. As soldier, mercenary, and general alike began to revive and recover, they often conceded. Fanatics on the one side would become fanatics on ours after such engagements. We had no shortage of those willing to die in battle as a gesture of their undying faithfulness. We had little need of those, though there were plenty. It was almost pathetic, witnessing the expression of extreme ideology crushed and claimed; they believed their acts were righteous, when their acts were naught more than deep emotion. Drained of that emotion, which carried always a bittersweet flavor, they fell at our feet and begged to become a part of our culture upon recovery.
