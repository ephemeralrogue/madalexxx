- Telepathic communication is not handled through impressions. Rather, because of The Fiend, hosts’ thoughts are freely accessible to one another. They learn to shield their thoughts and direct the ones they want to share. In later chapters, this will become useful as “internal dialogue” intentionally shared can be used as a means of manipulation. This is how the Elders will keep the Newborns in line.
	- As an aside--the possessed are able to read the minds of others not infected by The Fiend; however, this continues to be done through impressions.
	- this whole system needs to be better worked out.
- their secluded plateau should be at least two weeks’ travel from the closest settlement.
- Describe the wolves’ turning and training prior to the final delegation’s demise.
- Describe the loss of humanity a little more clearly, from the time he requests the first sacrifice to the time he turns the priestesses.
- "It seemed my transformation was complete; I no longer cared to protect humanity from this darkness within." [[09]] Provide more insight into this ultimate betrayal of his humanity.
	- This should be carefully balanced against the need to allow humans to proliferate in order to sustain their food source.
- When the temple is being created/upgraded, discuss the widening of the pass.
- When the narrator discusses his daily meditations, describe this as an opportunity for him to regularly meet with the High Priestesses via their shared telepathy.
- In Chapter [[14]], there is mention that most top positions in the Temple were taken by women, as they were far more vicious and cunning than their male counterparts. This should be better illustrated and drawn out to explain the change from “High Priestesses” to “High Clerics” in chapter [[15]], denoting the opening of the position to all genders.
- Reimagine the Rites of the Eclipse in chapter [[16]]. It takes weeks to travel to the Shrine of the Dark, the parade needs to be reconfigured. Otherwise, change the timing of travel to the Shrine to several hours.
- In chapter [[16]], it’s described that the Godhead will travel on palanquins loaded on large animals. Specify that these are not mounted until the first transition point that happens in chapter [[17]].
- Change “quarters” to “districts.”
- In chapter [[18]], as the priestesses fall upon the candidates, flesh that out a little more fully; the reader is in the crowd, watching the gruesome display. Make it feel gruesome.
- Figure out a better term than "newcomers" for the new High Clerics in chapters 18, 19, and beyond
	- I need a better way to differentiate between the original High Priestesses and the newcomers than just "High Priestesses" and "newcomers." Acolytes and Neophytes, perhaps? This requires some thought and research.
- "net of restraint": the going term for the numbing effect imparted by the main character and the High Priestesses in chapter [[19]]
- Consider the idea that the demon learns how humans utilize emotion, and thus learns how to manipulate humans to its whims
- Very obvious attacks on religious people in chapter [[20]]. How to make that more subtle?
- Constituency or congregation? What consist wording can I use to describe those who lived in the valley, in the shadow of the temple, under the wings of the Godhead?
- Ethics discussion in chapter [[21]]. Should this be discussed sooner? If so, when and how?
- Mythos surrounding the Godhead, along with bitter descriptions of the religiously inclined, need to be resolved. On the one hand, the main character addresses the idea that those of a religious bent are hypocritical, whereas in chapter [[21]] there is the discussion that their people emulated the self-control exercised by the Godhead.
- "Shrine of the Dark" introduced in chapter [[12]] ... change this to something more irreverent. Shrine of Radiance. Shrine of the Light. Shrine of Lightness
- The ritual to turn survivors into High Clerics is called the Festival of Ascension (chapter [[21]])
- In chapter [[25]], I begin describing the shadows interweaving themselves into the narrator. I should begin making this a thing much earlier in the narrative, perhaps after their first vision.
- Chapter [[26]] is a deep dive into the [[Candidate Selection Process]] and [[Candidate Training Program]]. This section may perhaps be more useful earlier in the narrative.
- Be more consistent with references to the void.
- In chapter [[27]], there is mention of how the narrator can pseudo listen in on humans' thoughts and pinpoint collective threats to the Godhead. Perhaps this ability should be made more prominent earlier in the text.
- Godhead? The Ascended? Playing with terms for the vampyric collective. "The Ascended" is introduced in chapter [[28]].

# Notes on Future Narratives
- Vampire hunters are denoted as Dark Weavers rather than Light Workers. Light Workers are those in servitude to the Shrine of Radiance (or whatever the fuck it will be called), whether vampires or their worshippers/constituents/servants. Turn the traditional associations of Light and Dark on their heads.
